---
* Implement and optimize attributed relation graph matching algorithm using graduate assignin

* Train a probabilistic parametric model based on the above algorithm to extract feature pattern from
multiple graphs automatically using EM algorithm

* Apply the above model in biology context and innovate a new way to match proteins in their tertiary
(three dimension) structure instead of their primary (linear) structure

* Leverage techniques in word embedding and generate feature vector for each amino acid

* Project is supported by Jerome A. Schiff Fellowship
